        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Sydnee D. Verbal</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Web-115: N801 Web Markup and Scripting  with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
