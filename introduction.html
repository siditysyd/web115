<b>Personal Background: </b>  I have been in IT for about 7 years now working as a pc technician, helpdesk analyst, digital art and website creator. 
	Prior to working in IT I worked as a barista, a childcare teacher as well as a customer service representative in my teens. </p>
	
<p>
	<b>Academic Background: </b>  I attended My Computer Career so that I could get some IT certifications after landing my first IT job at 19. </p>
	
<p>
	<b>Background in this subject: </b> I have been taking on many different roles in order to expand my skills as an IT tech. I plan to continue with IT for the rest of my life.
	I especially look forward to learning how to code for not only websites but also for mobile apps. </p>

<p>
<b> Primary Computer Background:</b> I primarily work on Windows laptops and desktops using Windows 10 and 11. 
</p>

<p>	Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:
<nav><ul>
<li>CIS-110 Introduction to Computers- To teach me about all things computers, from how they work to how they connect to one another to create different systems. It is also a requirement for my degree. </li>
<li>CIS-115 Intro into Programming and Logic – Of course this class is a requirement for my degree, but I also think that it’ll add to my knowledge as a programmer to be able to program using different languages
	to create different projects. </li>
<li>CTS- 240 Project Management-  This class is also a requirement for my degree but it will teach me how to successfully manage and plan for my work as a programmer as well as how to manage others (hopefully).  </li>
</ul>
	<p><b> Funny/ Interesting Item about Yourself: </b>I am a mother of 2 children, a 4 year old boy and a 1 year old girl. I am also a plant mom to 42 different plants and a dog mom to a Yorkipoo named Coco.
	Lastly, I love to cook and bake, so sometimes I sell my food. </p>
