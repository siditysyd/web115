	<h4>Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>MAT-171: Precalculus Algebra: I am taking this course because I have dropped it multiple times due to being too scared to take it online.  </li>
		<li>WEB-115: Advanced Markup and Scripting- I am taking this class to learn how to write and read code as well as correct it. I am also retaking this class as I had to withdraw last semester.   </li>
		<li>CTS-118: IS Professional Comm- I am taking this course since it is required for my degree but hopefully it teaches me how to communicate better.   </li>
		<li>PHI-240: Introduction to Ethics: I am taking this course because it is required for my degree. </li>
	</ul>
