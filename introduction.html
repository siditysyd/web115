<b>Personal Background: </b>  I have been in IT for about 7 years now working as a pc technician, helpdesk analyst, digital art and website creator. 
	Prior to working in IT I worked as a barista, a childcare teacher as well as a customer service representative in my teens. </p>
	
<p>
	<b>Academic Background: </b>  I attended My Computer Career so that I could get some IT certifications after landing my first IT job at 19. </p>
	
<p>
	<b>Background in this subject: </b> I have been taking on many different roles in order to expand my skills as an IT tech. I plan to continue with IT for the rest of my life.
	I especially look forward to learning how to code for not only websites but also for mobile apps. </p>

<p>
<b> Primary Computer Background:</b> I complete my work using a Lenovo laptop that is on Windows 11. 
</p>

<p>	Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:
<ul>
<li>MAT-171: Precalculus Algebra: I am taking this course because I have dropped it multiple times due to being too scared to take it online.  </li>
<li>WEB-115: Advanced Markup and Scripting- I am taking this class to learn how to write and read code as well as correct it. I am also retaking this class as I had to withdraw last semester.   </li>
<li>CTS-118: IS Professional Comm- I am taking this course since it is required for my degree but hopefully it teaches me how to communicate better.   </li>
<li>PHI-240: Introduction to Ethics: I am taking this course because it is required for my degree. </li>
</ul>
	<p><b> Funny/ Interesting Item about Yourself: </b>I am a mother of 2 children, a 5 year old boy and a 1 year old girl. I am also a plant mom to 42 different plants and counting. 
	Lastly, I love to cook and bake, so sometimes I sell my food. </p>
